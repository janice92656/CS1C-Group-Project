Key Selling Points

Our robots are made out of space grade materials used by NASA, to ensure a hardy 
robot that will not be destroyed by minor bomb detonations. This durability allows 
us to have such a remarkable satisfaction guarantee! 

Our robots also come equipped with numerous devices to ensure successful bomb 
removals, that our competitors cannot even hold a match to. Despite our far superior
build quality and the capabilities of our robots, we are able to offer our robots at the very 
reasonable prices.
