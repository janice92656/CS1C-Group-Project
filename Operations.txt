			Concept of Operations

Our robots are made to keep those out of harmâ€™s way when it comes to 
diffusing bombs or other explosive devices. Our robotics are operated with
a remote laptop that can be used up to a range of 500 meters in line of 
sight or within buildings. They are fully automated and have the ability
to climb staircases, maneuver down steep slopes and terrains, and have the
ability to move objects in order to reach their targets. Using a unique 
X-Ray device, our robots are able to detect bombs that could be hidden 
from plain sight and determine what the state of the detonator is. If need
be, each robot is equipped with a water jet disrupter that can be used to 
defuse a bomb and a portable shotgun that can be used to break open locked
doors or windows.
