These robots saved my life! My angry ex-boyfriend left a rather nasty surprise for 
me at my home, but I caught on, and sent in my robot first! Without him, I might 
have been a goner!

These robots, uhh, saved us. Without them, we could not do what we, umm, do. Irobots 
is the best.

This was my first bomb-removal bot, and I could not be happier. With it, I was 
able to safely defuse a bomb placed in an orphanage by some lunatic who ran 
away laughing and curling his fancy moustache. Easiest removal ever!

I got bored, so I defused my dogs poop with it. 10/10 would do again
